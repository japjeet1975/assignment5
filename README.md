# assignment 5

This assignment is for a daily schduler which allows us to view our tasks hourly basis

As per the current time , the task section will change its colour , 
If the task was supposed to be completed in past , the colour of todo section will be grey . 
If the task is for the current hour , then colour of the section will be red . 
If there are any future tasks to be completed, it would be shown in green colour. 

We have used moment.js for retrieing the current date and current time . 

We used bootstrap for the layout of the scheduler.

We have even stored all in local storage .
